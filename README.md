## Step 7 
1. Make a file following the given format: 
<YourName>.<fileExtension> (fileExtension can be - cpp, py, c, java depending upon which language you choose to code in)
Note that you may use any language you are comfortable in to do the same. 
  
2. Open this file in a code editor of your choice
3. Make a basic program to print - # What you love about OpenSource.
4. Once you have completed the program - You can create a Pull Request to integrate your contribution into the global remote repository.

Sample: 
Language: Python    
File Name - Pikachu.py  
File Content -   
print('I love Open Source because it helps me collaborate with other pokemons on projects which target a diverse skillset')
